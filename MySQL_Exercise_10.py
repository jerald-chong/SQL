Question 1: Write a query that will output distinct user_guids and their associated country of residence from the users table, excluding any user_guids or countries that have NULL values. You should get 16,261 rows in your result.
%%sql
SELECT DISTINCT user_guid, country
FROM users
WHERE user_guid IS NOT NULL AND country IS NOT NULL;

Question 2: Use an IF expression and the query you wrote in Question 1 as a subquery to determine the number of unique user_guids who reside in the United States (abbreviated "US") and outside of the US.
%%sql
SELECT IF (cleaned_users.country='US','In US', 'Outside US') AS user_location, COUNT(cleaned_users.user_guid) AS num_guid
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT user_guid, country
      FROM users
      WHERE user_guid IS NOT NULL AND country IS NOT NULL) AS cleaned_users
GROUP BY user_location;

Question 3: Write a query using a CASE statement that outputs 3 columns: dog_guid, dog_fixed, and a third column that reads "neutered" every time there is a 1 in the "dog_fixed" column of dogs, "not neutered" every time there is a value of 0 in the "dog_fixed" column of dogs, and "NULL" every time there is a value of anything else in the "dog_fixed" column. Limit your results for troubleshooting purposes.
%%sql
SELECT dog_guid, dog_fixed, 
    CASE dog_fixed
    WHEN '1' THEN 'neutered'
    WHEN '0' THEN 'not neutered'
    ELSE 'NULL'
    END AS neutered
FROM dogs
LIMIT 200;

Question 4: We learned that NULL values should be treated the same as "0" values in the exclude columns of the dogs and users tables. Write a query using a CASE statement that outputs 3 columns: dog_guid, exclude, and a third column that reads "exclude" every time there is a 1 in the "exclude" column of dogs and "keep" every time there is any other value in the exclude column. Limit your results for troubleshooting purposes.
%%sql
SELECT dog_guid, exclude,
    CASE exclude
    WHEN '1' THEN 'exclude'
    ELSE 'keep'
    END AS exclude_cleaned
FROM dogs
LIMIT 200;

Question 5: Re-write your query from Question 4 using an IF statement instead of a CASE statement.
%%sql
SELECT dog_guid, exclude, IF(exclude='1','exclude','keep') AS exclude_cleaned
FROM dogs
LIMIT 200;

Question 6: Write a query that uses a CASE expression to output 3 columns: dog_guid, weight, and a third column that reads...
"very small" when a dog's weight is 1-10 pounds
"small" when a dog's weight is greater than 10 pounds to 30 pounds
"medium" when a dog's weight is greater than 30 pounds to 50 pounds
"large" when a dog's weight is greater than 50 pounds to 85 pounds
"very large" when a dog's weight is greater than 85 pounds
Limit your results for troubleshooting purposes.
%%sql
SELECT dog_guid, weight,
    CASE 
    WHEN weight<=10 THEN 'very small'
    WHEN weight>10 AND weight<=30 THEN 'small'
    WHEN weight>30 AND weight<=50 THEN 'medium'
    WHEN weight>50 AND weight<=85 THEN 'large'
    WHEN weight>85 THEN 'very large'
    END AS size
FROM dogs
LIMIT 200;

Question 7: How many distinct dog_guids are found in group 1 using this query?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT dog_guid), 
CASE WHEN breed_group='Sporting' OR breed_group='Herding' AND exclude!='1' THEN "group 1"
     ELSE "everything else"
     END AS groups
FROM dogs
GROUP BY groups
4871

Question 8: How many distinct dog_guids are found in group 1 using this query?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT dog_guid), 
CASE WHEN exclude!='1' AND breed_group='Sporting' OR breed_group='Herding' THEN "group 1"
     ELSE "everything else"
     END AS group_name
FROM dogs
GROUP BY group_name
3461

Question 9: How many distinct dog_guids are found in group 1 using this query?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT dog_guid), 
CASE WHEN exclude!='1' AND (breed_group='Sporting' OR breed_group='Herding') THEN "group 1"
     ELSE "everything else"
     END AS group_name
FROM dogs
GROUP BY group_name
46

Question 10: For each dog_guid, output its dog_guid, breed_type, number of completed tests, and use an IF statement to include an extra column that reads "Pure_Breed" whenever breed_type equals 'Pure Breed" and "Not_Pure_Breed" whenever breed_type equals anything else. LIMIT your output to 50 rows for troubleshooting. HINT: you will need to use a join to complete this query.
%%sql
SELECT d.dog_guid AS DogID, d.breed_type AS breed_type, COUNT(c.created_at) AS num_tests,
    IF(d.breed_type='Pure Breed','pure_breed','not_pure_breed') AS Pure_breed
FROM dogs d, complete_tests c
WHERE d.dog_guid=c.dog_guid
GROUP BY DogID, breed_type, Pure_breed
LIMIT 50;

Question 11: Write a query that uses a CASE statement to report the number of unique user_guids associated with customers who live in the United States and who are in the following groups of states:
Group 1: New York (abbreviated "NY") or New Jersey (abbreviated "NJ")
Group 2: North Carolina (abbreviated "NC") or South Carolina (abbreviated "SC")
Group 3: California (abbreviated "CA")
Group 4: All other states with non-null values
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_guid), 
    CASE
    WHEN (state='NY' OR state='NJ') THEN 'Group 1'
    WHEN (state='NC' OR state='SC') THEN 'Group 2'
    WHEN (state='CA') THEN 'Group 3'
    ELSE 'Group 4'
    END AS groups_of_state
FROM users
WHERE country='US' AND state IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY groups_of_state;

Question 12: Write a query that allows you to determine how many unique dog_guids are associated with dogs who are DNA tested and have either stargazer or socialite personality dimensions.
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT dog_guid) AS num_dogs
FROM dogs
WHERE dna_tested=1 AND (dimension='stargazer' OR dimension='socialite');
